# Student-Behaviour-management

### It is a Student Behavior Analysis System. This system is used to record the Behavior of a student in a class.

### It consists of multiple user accounts 

-> The first one is a root account which is used to start the application 
-> Under this root, there are 3 types of users 
   admin user-> This user is responsible for adding teachers and students into the database and creating user accounts for them for their separate login 
   Teacher -> all the teachers have a unique ID and Password generated by the admin by using which they can log in to the system and grade the students according to their perception and observation.
   Student/Parent -> Here also the ID and password is provided to the student/parent by the admin, both the student and parent can log in using the same account to see the aggregate report.

Behavior observation is taken into account for evaluation:
    -> Attendance and on time 
    -> Attentive 
    -> Uniform 
    -> Behavior with fellow mates 
    -> General ethics with teachers 
    -> English spoken 
    -> Extra curriculum
